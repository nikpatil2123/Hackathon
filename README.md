## Objective

Blood donation is a crucial life-saving activity, yet awareness and convenience remain significant challenges. This project aims to digitalize the traditional blood donation process by replacing physical donor cards with a comprehensive digital platform. The digital card will maintain an accurate record of donations, reducing the risk of misplacement. It will also feature a reward point system to incentivize donors, promoting consistent participation.

The platform will include an alert system to ensure donors adhere to safe intervals between donations, typically 2-3 months. Additionally, a community feature will facilitate real-time assistance in cases of urgent blood requirements, fostering collaboration and mutual support among donors. By consolidating these functionalities into a single app, this initiative seeks to enhance user experience, encourage regular donations, and raise awareness about the importance of blood donation. This project aspires to create a connected, informed, and motivated donor network while addressing logistical challenges in the current system.
